The method we choose to store data on disk significantly impacts how easily and efficiently we can interact with it.

To ensure a smooth user experience, individuals should not have to dedicate a considerable amount of time to learning the intricacies of reading and writing data in a specific storage format.
Atomea addresses this by offering a unified interface that works seamlessly with various storage backends, abstracting away the underlying complexities for the user.

Users only have to specify stores for [arrays](/stores/arrays/) and [tables](/stores/tables/) for each [project (which we will discuss later)](/containers/levels/project/).
